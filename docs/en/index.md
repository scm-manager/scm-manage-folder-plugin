subtitle: Manage Folder Plugin Documentation

This documentation describes the usage of the scm-manage-folder-plugin. It is available in different languages and versions, which can be selected from the menu on the right.

The Manage Folder Plugin offers the possibility to create and delete folders recursively in the SCM-Mangager.
For empty folders, small files will be created, because Git and Mercurial for example cannot handle empty folders.
